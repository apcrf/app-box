app-box is a small modal box that appears on the device screen to inform the user about something.

A modal window in the graphical interface blocks the user from interacting with the application until it is closed.

app-box does not use additional frameworks, so it integrates seamlessly into any site.

To use app-box, you need to include a JS file:

<script defer src="app-box.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
